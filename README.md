# Welcome to Microservices Project using node js

# Microservices Architecture with Monorepo

This project is a microservices-based architecture using Node.js for backend services and React for the frontend. Each service operates independently and communicates with others through well-defined interfaces. The monorepo structure enables efficient development and maintenance.
[simple project contains graphQL , Caching , Authentication , API Authorization , Socket(if required)]

# Communication Flow

Services communicate using RESTful APIs, JWT-based authentication, and message queues for event-driven interactions.

Workflow:
The Auth Service handles authentication and issues JWTs.
Services validate JWTs to authorize requests.
Inter-service communication occurs via REST APIs or asynchronous messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ).

# Features

Authentication: Centralized authentication using the Auth Service and JWT.
Scalability: Each service can scale independently.
Modularity: Services are modular and loosely coupled.
Shared Code: Shared libraries (libs/) improve maintainability.
